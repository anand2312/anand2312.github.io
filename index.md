# Anand Krishna
Heyo, I'm Anand. I'm an 18-year old programmer - mainly write code in Python :snake:
Interested mostly in *databases* and *asynchronous programming*. This is my personal site, where I write about things I find interesting, or some short tutorials and explanations to concepts.\

_this site is still a work in progress._\
