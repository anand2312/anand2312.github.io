# Anand Krishna
Heyo, I'm Anand. I'm an 18-year old programmer - mainly write code in Python :snake:
Interested mostly in *databases* and *asynchronous programming*, but I love all things code :heart:. This is my personal site, where I write about things I find interesting, or some short tutorials and explanations to concepts.\
\
_this site is still a work in progress._\

 Thanks for checking by :D
